** Inspiration

After spending the past 10 days learning Emacs Doom, I've been really enjoying
learning more about emacs, org, doom, and especially emacs-lisp.
It's no longer intimidating! When installing [[github:d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][Emacs Plus]] it comes
(or at least, it used to) come with the Spacemacs icon.
It looks good, but it's just not Doom. This is Doom.

The game Doom inspired the emacs hacker [[https://github.com/hlissner][Henrik Lissner]] so naturally a cacodemon felt like the most interesting source to draw from and now here we are.

** What's next?

*** TODO Collect feedback
Make alterations, refine shapes, fix any bad resizes

*** TODO Try digitally painting a version
Can pull more life, texture, and structure out of the character

*** TODO Try 3D modeling a version
Seems like good practice for Blender's sculpting tools


** Goals

- Create a PR for emacs-plus :package:
- Push myself creatively :art:
- Have fun :sunglasses:


** Questions

*** How do I use this icon?

- Download the latest doom icon files [[https://github.com/eccentric-j/doom-icon/releases/latest/download/doom-icons.zip]]

**** On OS X
- Download the =doom.icns= file from one of the available icon directories
- In another tab or window, open the directory containing your Emacs.app
- Right or option-click Emacs.app and select "Get Info"
- Drag the `doom.icns` file to the icon on the top-left of the "Get Info" window

#+begin_src bash
EMACS_APP="/Applications/Emacs.app"
curl -o /tmp/doom.png https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eccentric-j/doom-icon/master/cute-doom/doom.png &&

  DeRez -only icns /tmp/doom.png >/tmp/icns.rsrc &&

**** Linux

(Thanks to [[https://github.com/drchsl][@drchsl]])

#+begin_src bash
ICON="$HOME/.local/share/icons/doom.png"
DESKTOP_FILE=/usr/local/share/applications/emacs.desktop
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eccentric-j/doom-icon/master/cute-doom/doom.png -O "$ICON" &&
sudo --preserve-env=ICON,DESKTOP_FILE sed -i "s|Icon=.*|Icon=$ICON|" $DESKTOP_FILE
#+end_src


**** Windows

(Thanks to [[https://github.com/elken][@elken]])

- Download the =doom.ico= file from one of the available icon directories
- Keep the containing directory open
- Download [[http://angusj.com/resourcehacker/#download][Resource Hacker]]
- Save in a useful place

Repeat the below section for both =emacs.exe= and =emacsclientw.exe=

***** Replace icon for exe

- Locate your emacs install directory (depends on if it has been installer with =choco= or the official installer)
- Open Resource Hacker
- Drag the exe into the window
- Left click on "Icon" on the left tree
- Right click -> Replace icon
- Locate the ICO file from before
- Replace
- Save

*** Want feedback?

Yes please! I love design-focused feedback. For example, "Can you change x so that y
because z?" is much more helpful to me than "x hurts my eyes".

*** Since you shared the sources would you be open to PRs with improvements?

Very yes!

*** What if I made my own icon I would like to add as an alternative?

Alternatives are welcome! Please note, there are some requirements:

- doom.png 1024x1024 pixels in size
- doom.iconset folder with expected sizes see [[./cute-doom/src/doom.iconset]] for reference
- doom.icns file for OS X (I can help with this if needed)
- doom.ico file for Windows users (use [[https://convertico.com/]])

*** Could the png, .icns, and .ico be generated automatically from a gh action?

This is a good idea and PRs are welcome but I don't think it's worth it until there
are more alternatives.

*** So you're trying to make this hideous thing the default\official Doom Emacs Icon?

Nope. It would be great if it was an additional option for builds like Emacs Plus.

*** What if I'm seeing the icon and I hate it. I even kinda hate you a little bit for even making it?

That's pretty brutal comrade. But if you feel that way, it is what it is.

*** Are you really going to do a digital painting and 3D model it?

Ideally yes! I have some experience with both those mediums and it seems like a
fun project. Depends on the feedback and motivation of course.

*** How do I convert the iconset folder into an =icns= file?

#+begin_src bash
iconutil -c icns ./doom.iconset
#+end_src

*** How come you used Adobe Illustrator and Adobe XD instead of other open-source projects?

That's what I like, that's what I'm used to. If you want to make a PR to replace
these icons more power to you.

*** Do you feel you're maybe overthinking this?

Yes! Yes I probably am.
